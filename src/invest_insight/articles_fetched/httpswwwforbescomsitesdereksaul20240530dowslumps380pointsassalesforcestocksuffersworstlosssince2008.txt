The Dow Jones Industrial Average faltered Thursday thanks in large part to a massive selloff for software giant Salesforce, as rosy artificial intelligence dreams have proven unable to support the blue chip stock index’s record highs.

Key Facts


The Dow fell nearly 1%, or 330 points, to its lowest level since May 1, despite 22 of its 30 member stocks gaining, with the headline losses owing to the 20% crash for Salesforce shares by midafternoon.



Salesforce stock’s drop followed the business software platform’s earnings report which included weaker revenue forecasts than expected and takeaways from analysts like Bernstein’s Mark Moerdler that investor “expectations must reset and reset lower.”



Shares of Salesforce fell Thursday to their lowest price since November, suffering its biggest one-day loss since 2004.



The S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite stock indexes were also negatively impacted by the Salesforce results, with the S&P declining 0.6% and the Nasdaq dipping 1.1%.

Crucial Quote
The Salesforce malaise is indicative of the investor angst about turning the AI hype into earnings growth surrounding pretty much every technology company other than Microsoft and Nvidia. Deutsche Bank analyst Brad Zelnick summarized Salesforce’s results “raise more meaningful questions around the adoption curve and ultimate monetization” of generative AI for software-as-a-service firms like Salesforce.

Big Number
$1.5 billion. That’s how much poorer Marc Benioff, Salesforce’s billionaire co-founder and CEO, got Thursday.
Key Background
After almost every stock tangentially related to AI enjoyed absurd returns in 2023, the rent has come due for many notable tech companies like Salesforce, Intel and Tesla, all of whom have fallen by more than 10% year-to-date even as indexes rose to record highs. Salesforce, which offers corporate clients a suite of software offerings including its sales-focused customer relationship software and workplace messaging service Slack, enjoyed a 100% stock gain in 2023, with investors excited by the potential of its Einstein machine learning analytics platform and other AI offerings.

Tangent
Nvidia has almost single handedly kept the stock market afloat recently, as its stock’s 22% gain since last Wednesday is far better than the median S&P stock’s 3% loss over the stretch, with the S&P down a more palatable 1% over the stretch.
