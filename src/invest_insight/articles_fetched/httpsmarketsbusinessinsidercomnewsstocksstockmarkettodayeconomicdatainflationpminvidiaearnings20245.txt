US stocks closed sharply lower on Thursday, with Nvidia's earnings in the rearview and traders dealing with fresh fears of sticky inflation and high interest rates. Nvidia shares soared on Thursday, a day after reporting earnings results that handily beat estimates and providing solid guidance for the current quarter. The stock rose as much as 12%, ultimately closing 9.3% higher at $1,037.99 per share. That was the extent of Thursday's bullishness, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 605 points, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite retreated from recent record highs. The drop came after new services and manufacturing PMI data topped economists' estimates, hinting at more inflation pressure for the US economy. In addition, jobless claims were lower than expected, underscoring the continued strength of the labor market. Last week, they came in at 222,000, versus estimates of 220,000.
