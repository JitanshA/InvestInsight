Key Facts


Nvidia’s stock sank by as much as 8% from its early morning all-time high to its afternoon nadir, with its share price down 3.5% on the day to $131 by close, reversing what was as much as a 4% gain shortly after Thursday’s open.



The intraday swing erased $277 billion of Nvidia’s market value, which sank to $3.27 trillion, placing Nvidia behind MIcrosoft after exceeding the market capitalization of the more established technology firm Tuesday.



There was no clear catalyst for the Nvidia selloff, indicating it was likely a matter of investors taking profits after the stock’s 170% rally year-to-date and 800% pop since the beginning of last year.



Nvidia stock is still up 40% over the last month alone.

Why Are Stocks Down Today?
Critically, the Thursday dip demonstrated the broader market’s sensitivity to Nvidia stock’s performance, as the S&P 500 turned its peak 0.3% morning gain to a 0.6% loss by around 1:45 p.m., with almost all of the fall explained by Nvidia. Essentially, Nvidia’s intraday slide erased the equivalent of Coca-Cola, the S&P’s 27th most valuable company with a roughly $270 billion market cap, from the index.

Key Background
It is highly normal for a stock to decline after a sharp increase like Nvidia just had. Broad index funds have benefited far more from Nvidia’s inclusion than they’ve been hurt, with Nvidia’s $2 trillion market cap added in 2024 accounting for a third of the market cap-weighted S&P’s 15% year-to-date gain. Nvidia, which produces a majority of the semiconductor technology most coveted for generative AI applications, reported a sixfold increase in earnings in its most recent quarter as customers like Microsoft and Google shell out for the technology.
Big Number
$345,000. That’s about how much $10,000 invested in Nvidia exactly five years ago would be worth today. The same amount invested in the S&P would be worth about $20,150.
