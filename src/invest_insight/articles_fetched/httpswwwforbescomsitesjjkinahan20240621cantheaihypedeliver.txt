Key Takeaways




Stocks Dipped Post-Holiday; S&P 500 Down 0.25%, Nasdaq 0.8%; Volatility Up Ahead Of Expiry.
Economic Focus Shifts To PMI, Home Sales Data; Fed's Powell Testimony On Monetary Policy Crucial.
Nvidia's AI Market Cap Surge Reversed; AI's Profitability Questioned Despite Enthusiasm.




Stocks closed slightly lower on Thursday following a rare midweek holiday. The S&P 500 fell 0.25% while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.8%. At the same time, volatility picked up with the VIX closing higher by 6.41% at 13.28. We'll see if any of that is foreshadowing a more volatile triple witching expiration today as equity options, futures and futures options all expire.

Speaking of today's expiration, earlier this week I discussed the possibility of increased midweek volatility because of the holiday, and I think that is what we saw Thursday. The loss of a day on a triple expiration week can have the effect of condensing the amount of available time to make adjustments or roll option trades out to the next month. We'll see if there is carryover from yesterday's volatility into today, especially in light of some of the economic data scheduled for release.

This morning, the most recent Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for both Services and Manufacturing will be released. We'll also get the latest data on sales of existing homes. However, the most important economic news will likely come from Federal Reserve Chairman Powell who is scheduled to appear before Congress to discuss the Fed's Monetary Policy Report. While I don't expect Powell to say anything different from what's been said of late with respect to interest rates, anytime Powell does speak, there is a chance for the market to have a bit of a knee-jerk reaction. Also, that testimony comes just a week before the next Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report, which could have a significant impact on future interest rate plans.
If there is a theme to stocks this year, it has been Artificial Intelligence (AI). On Tuesday, Nvidia, the poster child for AI, overtook Microsoft to become the company with the greatest market cap. Yesterday, however, shares of Nvidia fell 3.5% and back below the value of Microsoft. There is an interesting point to be made here and one brought up by Barron's as well. The AI enthusiasm we're seeing is mainly that, enthusiasm.

Very few companies other than Nvidia are actually generating direct profits as a result of AI. For most, AI is expected to help drive profits down the road, but at the moment, it's simply an expense as everyone ramps up investment. I think that's something worth keeping in mind because equity valuations are increasing based on expectations more than they are actual profitable revenue. It's reminiscent of the mid to late 1990s when companies began investing in online infrastructure but the profits from those investments didn't begin showing up for a number of years and in some cases, they didn't show up at all.

For today, in addition to any activity from Chairman Powell's testimony or expiration, I'm also watching shares of Honeywell. The company announced a $2 billion all-cash deal to buy CAES Systems, a company in the aerospace and defense sector. There's been some activity in this area of late, especially in light of the reemergence of Cold War rivalries. Earlier this week, Russia and North Korea signed a pact pledging support to one another and I expect foreign policy issues, as they relate to defense spending, are only likely to garner more attention as we near this year's election. As always, I would stick with your investing plans and long-term objectives.
