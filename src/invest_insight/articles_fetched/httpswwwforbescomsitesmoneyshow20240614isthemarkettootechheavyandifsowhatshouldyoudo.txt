It's not a bad thing for America, Americans, or the American stock market that the largest companies in the country are going up in price. The best players are scoring a lot of points. That's perfectly normal. In fact, if you go back and study every bull market over the past 100 years, you'll notice that technology is a leader in almost every single one of them.

Tech stocks doing well, and outperforming other sectors, is just a classic characteristic of a bull market.

The 2-year anniversary of this bull market is coming up this Sunday on June 16. That’s when the new lows list peaked at the end of the last bear market that first got going back in 2021.
Here...look for yourself. These are the returns for every sector going back to the beginning of this bull market:Bull MarketKoyfin

Technology is a standout leader. But Communications and Industrials are rounding out the top three. Then Financials and Consumer Discretionary represent the rest of the top five.
These are the types of sectors you would expect to see leading during bull markets. More defensive areas like Real Estate, Utilities, and Consumer Staples underperforming is also perfectly consistent with other bull markets from the past.

There are opportunities to buy stocks here. The question people are asking is: Sure, but which ones?

The great Peter Lynch once said, “The real key to making money in stocks is not to get scared out of them.” Hedge fund traders can be frightening as they move rapidly and often in tandem but most importantly, they are fickle. The sell-off in software stocks is the most recent example. But I have been saying for years that these companies are the new defensives.
Goldman Sachs reported that institutional investors sold technology stocks at the highest level over the last 11 weeks. Some 60% of that selling was in software stocks.
My experience has shown, and the hedge funds’ collective performance has confirmed, that it often makes sense to take advantage of the volatility they create. Look no further than Nvidia Corp.’s (NVDA) stock powering ever higher after the recent earnings report. Why? Because the hedge funds are piling in. Chips, chips, chips, and more chips!
Salesforce Inc. (CRM) spooked the market with weak guidance. I think that is more about CRM’s model and limited use cases for AI in their software offering than a verdict on all software companies – particularly the cloud hyperscale’s. Cloud computing accelerated last quarter at Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL).
They continue to turn in double digit earnings growth, they outearn the SPX, dividends and dividend growth are increasingly in the mix, and they are actually benefitingfrom higher interest rates.GrowthStrategas
Finally, I want to share a few words about S&P 500 concentration. We hear it repeated almost daily that the market is being driven and dominated by the Mag Seven, the Fab Five, or simply NVDA. But it is important to note that the SPX is the least concentrated index of the major developed global indices.

Inflation cooled for the second straight month in May, the US labor market seems back to pre-pandemic levels, and the economy is expanding at a low but steady pace. Therefore, the Fed is holding back on interest rate cuts. Probably the right move. Keep the ammo dry for when it is really needed. Meanwhile, I like ASML Holding NV (ASML).
A wall of active and passive money flows still supports the stock market, though the narrowness of the rally bothers me a bit. The 10 largest stocks represent about 34% of the value of the S&P 500 versus 27% in 2000 – right before the sharp dotcom-era pullback.
Volatility is also picking up, with more stocks experiencing sharp swings even on days that the overall market moves very little. This ought to be a great setup for stock picking. My goal is to help you navigate the risk and uncertainty that is out there, but not at the expense of missing out on opportunities.
This is why we start with a solid ETF base, add some dominating blue-chip stocks, and then add a layer of disruptive, aggressive stocks that offer us more upside potential for taking on more risk and volatility.
The key is to have some balance – to avoid going overboard in any sector or chasing any trend since the future is unknowable.ASMLQuotemedia
As for ASML, its shares recently popped from 1,045 to 1,069 in their first week as a recommendation. ASML makes the lithography equipment that manufacturers use to make advanced chips.
By 2026, ASML’s revenue could reach at least $40 billion as the market for AI chips is projected to grow at an annual rate of 36% through 2030. This is an aggressive stock trading at a high multiple to earnings and sales, so you may want to move incrementally in building a position.
Recommended Action: Buy ASML.
John Divine Patrick Duffy US News & World Report
John Divine is assistant managing editor of investing at US News & World Report, while his colleague Patrick Duffy is senior real estate economist there. In this MoneyShow MoneyMasters Podcast episode, which you can watch here, the three of us discuss the current and future states of the residential and commercial real estate markets – and how investors can navigate shifting industry conditions.
John and Patrick begin by discussing their backgrounds, which include a combined three-plus decades analyzing, researching, consulting for, and writing about the industry. Patrick then shares his take on the housing market, including its two main challenges – and the emerging one that’s bedeviling more home buyers (and owners) in more states with each passing day. John next discusses the “Golden Handcuff” problem, how creative financing structures like “subject-to financing” can help in some cases, and what it all means for publicly traded home builders. In his words: “You can build all the homes you want. But if people can’t afford them…it’s not a great environment.”
Next up is a chat about commercial real estate. Patrick weighs in on multifamily oversupply in the South and the re-emergence of rent control efforts in higher-priced regions...reasons why retail real estate is rebounding...how some office markets are stabilizing because the “extend and pretend” trend is winding down...and more. His overall take: “Like everything else, it’s very sector- and geography-specific.”
John then shares his thoughts on real estate loan and CMBS

 expect “utter and total chaos” for one major reason. We start wrapping up with a discussion of REITs as an investment – including why they’ve struggled for the past 12-18 months and the one development John thinks could really get the sector going again. Patrick also opines on why certain REIT subsectors are doing better (and worse) than others.
Finally, John and Patrick conclude with a quick chat about what they will cover at the MoneyShow Masters Symposium Las Vegas, set for Aug. 1-3, 2024 at the Paris Las Vegas.
