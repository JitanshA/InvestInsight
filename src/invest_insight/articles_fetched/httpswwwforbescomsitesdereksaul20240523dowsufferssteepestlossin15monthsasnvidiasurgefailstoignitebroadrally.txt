Thursday was a bizarre day for the stock market, as one major index suffered its biggest daily decline in more than a year while the buzziest stock on the planet staged the second biggest daily gain of any company in history.

Key Facts


The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.5%, or 605 points, the largest point loss since Feb. 21, 2023 for the index, which closed at its lowest level since May 8.



Shares of all 30 of the blue chip American companies listed on the Dow declined, with the likes of big technology companies like Intel (shares down 4%), Apple (down 2%) and Amazon (down 1%) among the biggest losers.



Losses for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite, the other two most commonly cited stock indexes, were narrower, as the benchmark S&P slid 0.7% and tech-heavy Nasdaq dipped 0.4%, thanks in large part to those indexes’ inclusion of one stock the Dow doesn’t: Nvidia.



While many of its peers floundered on the open market, Nvidia’s stock surged by 9% after the semiconductor chip designer’s reported exceptional quarterly earnings.


Nvidia’s more than $220 billion market capitalization surge Thursday is the second-largest daily valuation gain ever, trailing only the $277 billion the company added the day after its February earnings report.

Why Are Stocks Down If Nvidia Shares Skyrocketed?
Generally, it’s a reminder of the zero-sum game often present in financial markets. If investors are eager to buy on one asset, like Nvidia on Thursday, they need to get the cash to do so somehow, like selling off other stock holdings. To illustrate this point, look at how the rest of the “magnificent seven” big technology stocks other than Nvidia performed Thursday. Shares of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft and Tesla fell 0.4% or more, wiping out a combined $168 billion in market value. That sum is fairly similar to the $220 billion Nvidia gained Thursday.

Key Background
Other than portfolio repositioning, broadly weighing on equities were lingering monetary policy concerns after the Federal Reserve lamented about the “disappointing” recent progress on taming inflation. With stickier inflation, the market increasingly believes the Fed will hold interest rates higher than previously thought, with futures trading pricing in just 25 basis points worth of interest rate cuts this year, a far cry from the 150 basis points priced in at the beginning of the year. Higher interest rates weaken stock valuations, as higher interest expenses pose significant profit headwinds considering most companies use debt to fund operations. Stocks remain up big this year, with the Dow up 4%, the S&P up 10% and the Nasdaq up 11%, excluding dividends, all within 2% of their all-time highs achieved earlier this month.
