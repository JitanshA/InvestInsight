Stocks recovered Friday as the S&P 500 scored its fifth consecutive winning week, a rally unsurprisingly captained by the mammoth technology stocks behind much of the market’s hot stretch dating back to the end of 2022.

Key Facts


The S&P 500 rose 0.7% Friday, paring losses from Thursday’s surprise selloff, with the most widely cited American equity index ending the unofficial final week of spring narrowly in the green, closing 0.3% short of Tuesday’s all-time high.



The Nasdaq Composite, which rose 1% Friday, cleared its all-time high set Tuesday, while the less tech-heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average rose a modest .01%, some 2.3%, or 930 points, below its historic close over 40,000 last Friday.



Driving Friday’s gains were the “magnificent seven” big tech stocks—Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla.



The septet added a collective $182 billion in market value, led by Nvidia’s $65 billion gain, as shares of all but Amazon rose 0.7% or more, with the online retail giant falling a comparatively poor 0.2%.

Surprising Fact
At $14.4 trillion, the magnificent seven’s combined market capitalization is 31% of the S&P’s aggregate market value of $47 trillion. Alternatively, the average magnificent seven company is worth $2.1 trillion, while the other 493 S&P companies are worth an average of $66 billion.

Key Background
The stock market’s heavy concentration at the top is also true for profits, as the seven tech titans’ $108 billion in net income during 2024’s first quarter accounted for a quarter of the S&P’s total profits of $426 billion. Investor belief in the technology companies most poised to benefit from the artificial intelligence revolution, specifically semiconductor chip architect Nvidia, has buoyed the stock market in an otherwise unfriendly environment. Interest rates remain at the two-decade high they reached last summer, and market expectations for when rates will come down continue to be pushed out, a hindrance for stocks as higher rates typically make profits leaner.
