The Nasdaq continues to rally, something that makes big headlines, and yet certain key breadth indicators are not going along with the excitement. This is the result of the heavy weighting of the hot big cap tech components like NVIDIA
SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust
 and Apple. Most of the Nasdaq components are either not rallying to great extent or they’re selling off.


Take a look at the decreasing number of new highs for the Nasdaq:

Right now, that number sits at 146, down from last week’s 227 and down from the May high of just under 300. Each time NVIDIA makes a new high, fewer and fewer Nasdaq components make their own new highs. This is the kind of negative breadth divergence that concerns close observers of the markets.


Note that the peak came last December at just above 475 and since then, each Nasdaq new high is met with fewer overall new highs for component stocks. It’s almost as if money is flowing out of everything else and flowing into the AI-chip maker and a few other hot names.

This is the number of Nasdaq advancing stocks minus the number of Nasdaq declining stocks. It’s now lower than it was in mid-April even as the index itself has been hitting new highs. The peak for this indicator came in late December, almost 6 months ago.

It’s another instance of a breadth indicator showing the difference between the recent Nasdaq new highs and the inability of much of the index components to make their own new highs. The peak came in December 2023 and since then, fewer and fewer stocks in the Nasdaq are able to stay above their 50-day moving average.
Here’s the Nasdaq Composite Bullish Percent Index:Nasdaq COMPQ bullish percent index daily chart, 6 19 24.stockcharts.com
This is the old-school technical indicator that shows the percent of index stocks now in bullish point-and-figure patterns. The peak came in late December 2023 at just above 60% and has since declined to as low as 44%. After a late April/early May rally, the indicator is now at 48%. It’s much lower than the peak even as the Nasdaq Composite (and NVIDIA) keep hitting higher highs.
It’s a peculiar situation to see such a wide divergence between the complete index price and the best underlying breadth indicators. So much money has flowed into a select handful of hot stocks that what usually amounts to normal is now fully abnormal. What this may portend for the market as a whole is a subject of intense speculation.
