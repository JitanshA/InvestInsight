The S&P 500 index closed Tuesday’s trade at 5,321.41, setting a new all-time high, above the record close on May 15. The top 10 holdings of the S&P 500 have played a key role in influencing the index’s strong returns in recent years. However, these top 10 S&P 500 stocks by weight now represent about 32.5% (or nearly one-third) of the index, triggering fears of overconcentration risks and a possible market downturn. Are these concerns justified or unwarranted?


The S&P 500 Index: Benchmark For Broader Market Performance
The S&P 500 index is a proxy for large-cap U.S. equities, which are typically prone to lesser volatility, thereby more suitable as core holdings for most investors. The S&P 500 index tracks the performance of 500 publicly traded large U.S. companies across all sectors and covers nearly 80% of available market capitalization. This means the stocks included in the S&P 500 index represent approximately 80% of the value of the U.S. stock market. So, the S&P 500 is also considered a benchmark for the performance of the broader market. Interestingly the S&P 500 index actually has slightly more than 500 components (503 as of April 30), because a few companies have two classes of shares listed.

The S&P 500 was the first U.S. market-weighted stock market index. This means the larger the market value of the company included in the index, the greater weight it carries in the index. (The market cap/value of a company is the product of its outstanding shares and stock price).

Top 10 Stocks Of The S&P 500: Driving Exceptional Returns, But Also Triggering Overconcentration Fears
The top 10 holdings of the S&P 500 by weight have contributed more than a third of gains of the S&P 500’s 16% annualized total return over the last five years, compared to its 30-year annual average return of 10%. The S&P 500 closed at a new all-time high of 5,321.41 on May 21, and the top 10 stocks have been a key, collective driver for this stellar performance. On the other hand, the top 10 S&P 500 stocks by weight now represent about 32.5% (or nearly one-third) of the index, reaching the highest levels in decades. This has given rise to fears of overconcentration risks and a possible slump in the market, even as it sets new record highs.

How Does The S&P 500 Differ From Other Indices? 
The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and the Nasdaq Composite are the three headline indices that gauge market performance.
Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), which closed at a record high of 40,003.59 on May 17, tracks 30 U.S. blue-chip stocks. DJIA is price-weighted, meaning stocks with higher prices have a greater influence on the index, regardless of size or market cap. In a price-weighted index, price changes in the highest-priced stocks have a greater impact on the index vs. price changes in the low-priced stocks. This is the reason why DJIA does not include very high-priced stocks, as price changes in these stocks could skew the index and render it a less reliable gauge of overall market performance.
For inclusion in the Dow 30, the parameters considered are the reputation of the company, its history of sustained growth, high levels of interest from investors in the company and its sector representation of the broader market. In the last decade or more, tech companies have been added to the Dow 30, reflecting the growth of the technology sector within the U.S. equity market. However, the Dow does not include utilities or transportation companies, which are tracked separately in the Dow Jones Utility Average and the Dow Jones Transportation Average.
The S&P 500 Index
The S&P 500 is a float-adjusted market-capitalization weighted index. Float-adjusted or free-float market cap, unlike regular market cap, takes into account only free-floating shares for the calculation of market value. In the calculation of market value under float adjustment, only shares that are available for public trading are included. Shares held by other publicly traded companies, government agencies, or certain types of strategic shareholders typically represent investments made more for control purposes than economic gains and are excluded from outstanding share count under float adjustment.
More than 5,000 stocks are listed on the NYSE and the Nasdaq stock exchanges. At 2023-end, there were 2,272 listed domestic and international companies on the NYSE and 3,432 on the Nasdaq according to global data and business intelligence platform Statista.
So, what is the yardstick for stock inclusion in the S&P 500 index?


Only U.S. companies qualify for inclusion.
All eligible common U.S. equities trading on eligible U.S. exchanges are eligible for inclusion.
REITs also qualify. But American Depositary Receipts (ADRs), American depositary shares (ADS), exchange-traded funds (ETFs), closed-end funds and some other types of securities are ineligible.
Eligible companies should have an unadjusted market cap of $18 billion or more and a float-adjusted market cap that is at least 50% of the unadjusted minimum market cap threshold.
An investable weight factor (IWF) of at least 0.10 is needed for eligibility. The IWF determines the percentage of shares available for trading and ranges from zero to one, with zero meaning no shares available, and one meaning all shares are available.
A minimum trading volume of 250,000 shares in the six months leading up to the evaluation date is required and the ratio of the annual dollar value traded (a product of average closing price over the period and historical trading volumes) to float-adjusted market capitalization must be at least 0.75 to confirm adequate liquidity and reasonable price.
The company should have reported positive earnings for the most recent quarter as well as for the last four quarters collectively to ensure financial viability.
Sector balance criteria defines the need for inclusion of companies to offer a well-rounded representation of diverse economic sectors, so the index can more accurately reflect the performance of the broader market.


The Nasdaq Composite Index
The Nasdaq Composite index, which closed Tuesday’s trade at a new record high of 16,832.63 for the second day in a row this week, is a market-capitalization weighted index, like the S&P 500. However, it is seen as a barometer of the technology sector, which represents more than 50% of the index. One of the criterions for inclusion in the Nasdaq Composite index is the stock has to be listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. The index reached new pandemic-induced highs in 2021, and set a new all-time high of 16,742.39 on May 15, 2024, before breaking that record on May 20. It should be noted that the Nasdaq Composite index took 15 years to recover from its 4000-point crash from previous highs of 5,046.86 on March 9, 2000, after the burst of the dotcom bubble.

The Top 10 S&P 500 Stocks By Weight
The top 10 holdings of the S&P 500 represent 32.5% or a third of the index. The weights below are based on holdings of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) that closely mimics the S&P 500 index. The table was compiled on May 21, 2024.

The Top S&P 500 Stocks: Boon Or Bane?
The top 10 S&P 500 holdings by weight represent about 32.5% of the index, much higher than 17.8% in 2015, and also ahead of the 27% at the peak of the dotcom bubble in 2000. The concentration of the top 10 stocks within the S&P 500 index has reached the highest level in decades, stoking fears of overconcentration risks and the necessity for diversification away from these top 10 holdings.
However, elevated concentration levels are not uncommon in the history of the index. The top 10 stocks of the S&P 500 represented more than 40% of the index in the mid-1960s, and above 30% in early 1970s, mainly due to the influence of the Nifty 50 stocks that included Xerox, General Electric, IBM and Coca-Cola and more–the “buy and never sell stocks” of that era. (Now, the Nifty 50 refers to the benchmark Indian stock market index tracking 50 of the largest Indian companies listed on India’s National Stock Exchange or NSE.) The concentration level of the largest stocks within the S&P 500 sobered down to approximately 17% to 20% of the S&P 500 index in the next two decades until the late 1990s and then rose to 27% during the dotcom boom.
It should be noted that the “top 10 concentration” has reached high levels in other countries as well. China, the second largest global economy, has a 43.1% concentration of its top 10 holdings, Canada 44.1%, France 58.5%, Germany 57.3% and U.K. 49.8%. (Data is taken from the ETFs closely mimicking the broader indexes of these countries).
Goldman Sachs Research says the high levels of the top 10 concentration have helped boost S&P 500 returns in recent years. Over the last five years, the S&P 500 has returned an impressive annualized 16%, outpacing its 30-year average of 10%. Interestingly, the top 10 stocks have driven more than a third of these gains. Despite this, the valuation of the top 10 stocks is currently lower than the valuation of the largest stocks during the peak of the dotcom bubble. The top 10 stocks of the S&P 500 trade at a collective forward Price/Earnings or P/E multiple of approximately 34x, lower than the 43x multiples of the dotcom bubble peaks.
Goldman Sachs Research also found the S&P 500 rallying more often vs. declining in the 12 months subsequent to past instances of peak concentration, after examining S&P 500 market cap concentrations over the past century. The research firm identified seven episodes, in which the 10 largest stocks of the S&P 500 showed “extreme concentration,” and the stocks continued to rally in most of these periods after reaching peak concentration. Goldman Sachs Research cited the most recent instances of peak concentration in 2009 and 2020, and the subsequent stock rally accompanied by a stronger macroeconomic outlook.
However, Goldman Sachs Research also draws parallels between the present prevailing conditions and episodes in 1973 and 2000, when “the peak of equity market concentration also marked the peak of a bull market, and the economy entered recession” in the subsequent year, but also adds that the current market leaders of the S&P 500 “have higher profit margins and returns on equity than the top stocks in either 1973 or 2000.”
The Goldman Sachs Research article was published on March 21 this year and it should be noted that all the three indices–the Dow 30, S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite–have set new all-time highs within two months.
Not to forget the fact that the majority of the top 10 S&P 500 stocks are well positioned to benefit significantly from the AI boom, which in the opinion of tech analysts is just getting started. AI has evolved from chipmakers like Nvidia to titans like Google and Microsoft, and Apple, which is yet to fully explore the potential of AI.
With 93% of S&P 500 companies having reported first-quarter 2024 earnings, the blended (combines actual results for companies that have reported and estimated results for companies yet to report) year-over-year EPS growth for the first quarter is 5.7% for the S&P 500. If the actual EPS growth settles at 5.7% for the quarter, it will mark the highest year-over-year earnings growth rate reported by the S&P 500 since second-quarter 2022 when it posted 5.8% growth. Alphabet, Meta and Amazon were the largest contributors to earnings growth in the communication services and consumer discretionary sectors.
The communication services sector reported the highest (year-over-year) earnings growth rate of 34.2% among the S&P 500’s 11 sectors. Alphabet (EPS of $1.89 vs. year-ago $1.17) and Meta Platforms ($4.71 vs. year-ago $2.20) were the largest contributors to earnings growth for the sector. Excluding these two companies, the blended (year-over-year) earnings growth rate for the communication services sector would fall to 1.8% from 34.2%.
The consumer discretionary sector is reporting the third-highest (year-over-year) earnings growth rate of 24.5%, thanks to Amazon.com ($0.98 vs. year-ago $0.31). Excluding Amazon,, the blended (year-over-year) earnings growth rate for the consumer discretionary sector would fall to 2.4% from 24.5%.
The information technology sector is reporting the fourth-highest (year-over-year) earnings growth rate of 23.6%. Nvidia, which is expected to report first-quarter earnings on May 22, after the bell, is seen as the largest contributor to earnings growth for the sector based on estimated earnings. If Nvidia is excluded, the blended (year-over-year) earnings growth rate for the information technology sector would fall to 10.8% from 23.6%. Nvidia is also seen as the largest contributor to earnings growth for the entire S&P 500. Excluding Nvidia, the blended earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 would fall to 3.2% from 5.7%.
Wall Street expects S&P 500 to earn $245/share in 2024, while the top 10 stocks of the S&P 500 are estimated to generate a combined $150 in EPS for the current fiscal year.
With the Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 already setting new highs again, the probability of new records for all three indices cannot be ruled out, even as investors look forward to the first-quarter earnings report from S&P 500’s top 10 component and AI leader Nvidia on May 22, after the bell.
In a twist to the tale, Morgan Stanley departed from its pessimistic stance on the U.S. markets, and raised its base case 12-month target price for the S&P 500 to 5,400, from its prior expectations for the S&P 500 to decline to 4,500. The new price target represents less than a 2% rise from S&P 500’s current price levels.
Bottom Line
The top 10 stocks of the S&P 500 have driven the stellar performance of the index thus far. The overconcentration of the index in the top 10 holdings is definitely a cause for concern. However, robust financial performance and significant AI tailwinds quell the downside fears for now, implying positivity for the near future. Investors also must remember that past performance is no guarantee of future outcomes.
