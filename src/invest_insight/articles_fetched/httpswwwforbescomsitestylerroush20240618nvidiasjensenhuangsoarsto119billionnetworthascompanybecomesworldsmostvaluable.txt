Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang is now the 11th-richest person in the world after his net worth increased by more than $4 billion on Tuesday, scoring his highest ranking yet on Forbes’ real-time billionaire list, as the chip designer rode an artificial intelligence-driven surge to become the world’s most valuable public company.

Key Facts


Huang’s net worth increased to around $119 billion as of Tuesday afternoon as Nvidia shares traded up more than 3% to $135.70, ranking him ahead of Mukesh Ambani, India’s richest person, and behind former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer.



Huang—who owns a 3% stake in Nvidia—started the year with a net worth of $77 billion, according to Forbes’ estimates, before the company’s market cap increased by 177% to $3.33 trillion.



Nvidia said in a securities filing last month Huang would sell 600,000 shares of the company through March 2025, which would net him just over $81.4 million at the company’s current share price.

Big Number
$114 billion. That’s how much Huang’s net worth has increased since 2019, when Forbes estimated him to be the 546th-richest person in the world. Huang was worth $21 billion last year, ranking him as the world’s 76th-richest person.

Key Background
Huang has served as Nvidia’s chief executive and president since cofounding the company in 1993. Nvidia went public in 1999 and has surged in trading in recent years as it dominates the market for the chips needed to power artificial intelligence software, most recently surpassing the market cap of Microsoft and Apple. The company recently executed a stock split—when a company increases the number of shares without diluting the stock’s value—that cut Nvidia’s share price below $130 after trading above $1,200.
